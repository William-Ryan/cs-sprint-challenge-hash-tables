    1. Hashing functions - Hashing functions grab the hash function of a value, and a hash value is displayed in integers.
    2. Collision resolution - When a hash function maps two different keys to the same table address, that is collision.  Python uses dictionaries to handle collission resolution, and can result to linear probing a table to finding an empty slot.
    3. Performance of basic hash table operations - Insert, Delete, and Search are the basic hash table operations.
    4. Load factor - Load factor is how full the hash table can get before its capacity is automatically increased.
    5. Automatic resizing - If load factor goes over 70% ( 0.7 ) set up auto resizing that would be the act of increasing the has table.
    6. Various use cases for hash tables
        - Search for elements within a large data set.
        - Find duplicate elements in a data set.
        - Quickly store and retrieve elements from a large data set.
